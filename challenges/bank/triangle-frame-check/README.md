# Triangle Frame Safety Check

**5 points**

**CS concepts:** triangle inequality; upper bounds

## Scenario

A robotics team is building a triangular brace with two fixed bars. They need to know the longest integer length the third bar could have while still forming a triangle.

## Parameters

- `side1`: a positive integer for the first bar's length in centimeters.
- `side2`: a positive integer for the second bar's length in centimeters.

## Expected behavior

Return the largest possible positive integer length for the third side. No side can equal or exceed the sum of the other two.

## Your task

Edit [`solution.py`](solution.py). Keep the function name `solution` and its parameters unchanged.

```python
def solution(side1, side2):
    # Write your code here.
```

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

```python
solution(6, 11)
```

**Output**

```python
16
```

### Example 2

**Input**

```python
solution(3, 3)
```

**Output**

```python
5
```

Return the required value rather than printing it.
