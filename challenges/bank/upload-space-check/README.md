# Upload Space Gatekeeper

**5 points**

**CS concepts:** comparison operators; arithmetic; boundary values

## Scenario

A student is saving a project backup to a storage drive. Before transferring the file, the application checks available space to avoid a failed upload.

## Parameters

- `capacity`: a nonnegative integer for the drive's total space in megabytes.
- `used`: a nonnegative integer for space already occupied in megabytes.
- `size`: a nonnegative integer for the new file size in megabytes.

`used` does not exceed `capacity`.

## Expected behavior

Return `True` if the file fits without exceeding the drive's capacity, or `False` otherwise. Filling the last available megabyte is allowed.

## Your task

Edit [`solution.py`](solution.py). Keep the function name `solution` and its parameters unchanged.

```python
def solution(capacity, used, size):
    # Write your code here.
```

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

```python
solution(256, 240, 16)
```

**Output**

```python
True
```

### Example 2

**Input**

```python
solution(256, 240, 20)
```

**Output**

```python
False
```

Return the required value rather than printing it.
