# Missing Library Badge

**10 points**

**CS concepts:** Lists, number sequences, problem decomposition

## Scenario

A school gives visitors badges numbered consecutively from 1. During inventory, a librarian has a shuffled list of the returned badges and discovers that exactly one badge is missing.

## Parameters

- `badges`: a list containing each badge number except one, in any order and without duplicates.
- `total`: a positive integer representing the largest badge number.

Badge numbers run from 1 through `total`.

## Expected behavior

Return the missing badge number as an integer. For a single-badge collection, the list is empty, and the missing number is 1.

## Your task

Open [`solution.py`](solution.py). Complete the function named `solution` without changing its name or parameters.

```python
def solution(badges, total):
    # Write your code here.
```

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

```python
solution([4, 2, 1, 6, 3], 6)
```

**Output**

```python
5
```

### Example 2

**Input**

```python
solution([3, 2], 3)
```

**Output**

```python
1
```

### Example 3

**Input**

```python
solution([], 1)
```

**Output**

```python
1
```

Return the required value rather than printing it.
